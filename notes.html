HTML documents are the building blocks of the web
the web is basicli made up of these documents
HTML is made uo of text that the user willread in thier browser
Mark up which tells the browser what that text should look like or how it is arranged and withinmarku it can be
Within mark up there can be references to include athor documents and files like images and videos
Mark up is just a text that has special meaning
em stands for emphasis
em makes text emphasized or in italics every element starts and ends with a tag the one in the beggining has a less-than sign and the end has greater than sign there is atag has less than slash em greater than The first tag is called an oppening or a start tag and the one at the end is called closing or end tag The HTML tags start with less than and end with greater than these tags is called with programmers an angle brackets because they are shaped like a sharp angle the angle brackets always comes in pairs The first and last choices do not use HTML tags correctly, but the second and third do use them correctly. The opening tag is matched by an closing tag. The text is an opening tag. An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. great In practice, you'll often see people (including us!) mix up the terms element and tag. You can usually tell what they mean by the context. Although there's all kinds of whitespace added to the second example, this doesn't show up when we open it in a browser. Check out the next page to learn more! br stanfs for break as in line break
there is no closing tag fo br because it doesn not have any content there is nothing inside line break

we will see more HTML elements like this later ones that do not have a closing tag at all because they do not have any <content element like this are called void elements or empty elements
Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and line breaks. When the browser displayusually tell what they mean by the context.

Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and line breaks. When the browser displays an HTML file, it treats a run of whitespace as a single space character. In order to create a line break that will show up in the browser, use the
tag.
to make a paragraph in HTML we use p element p stands for paragraph it is a regular tag

Paragraphs definitely look better than running all the text together into one big block, don't they?
Correct! You can Generally speaking, it's usually better to use the p e

Correct! You can Generally speaking, it's usually better to use the p element for something like this. You'll learn more about why later on. As a rule, though, it's good to "tell the truth" in your HTML code: if a piece of text _is_ a paragraph, you should call it a paragraph; and the way to do that is with a p element. Any text editor that uses plain text should work. Code editors use plain text and have extra features to make your life easier (such as syntax highlighting). But stay away from word processors for HTML and programming â€” these add extra data that can break your code! sub and sup stand for "subscript" and "superscript". Originally, HTML started out as a tool for scientific and academic work; and these are really useful for science and math, like writing x2+3x+4 = 1 or chemical formulas like H2O. mark it is us
H2O. mark it is used for high liting they are calledtypographic elements tey are used to say that the browser should sisplay text in defferent way HTML page can gogo inside other elements but they have to follow some certain rules when they do
Only the third example is correct.
The first example starts with an open <p> tag, but then right after it has a closing /em tag. But there's no open <em> tag before it. It's not right to close an element that hasn't been opened. This example actually has the closing and opening em tags backwards from how they should be.
The second one has open <p>, open <em>, open <mark>, but then it has a closing </em> without a closing mark> first. It's trying to make the mark element overlap with the em element. If we give this to a browser, it will probably figure out what we mean, because browsers are actually really lenient. But this is technically wrong HTML.

And the third one is just fine. It has an open <p>, open <em>, open <mark>, close </mark>, close </em>, close </p>. Nice and symmetrical.
